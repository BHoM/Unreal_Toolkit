# BHoM

A great place to start is reading our Wiki [here](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki) including pages like the [Structure of the BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Structure-of-the-BHoM) and [Using the BHoM](https://github.com/BHoM/documentation/wiki/Using-the-BHoM).

## Quick start ##

Try the [installer](http://bhom.xyz/assets/installers/v2.1/BHoM%20Alpha%20v2.1.0.5%20Installer.exe) and a selection of [sample scripts](https://github.com/BHoM/samples).



## Building the BHoM and the Toolkits from Source ##
You will need the following to build BHoM:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 or higher
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and above (included with Visual Studio 2013)
- Note that there are no software - specific dependencies (only operating system relevant), this is specific: BHoM is a software agnostic object model.


### Clone and build the Core BHoM Repos
More specific instructions on this can be found on the [Unreal_Toolkit wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/Unreal_Toolkit/wiki/Unreal_Toolkit-wiki).
